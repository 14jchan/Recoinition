1- Overview
The objective here is to identify a coin based on a phone-camera picture.

There are a few difficulties that make this challenge a little bit more complicated than bill or form identificaiton:
* letters and numbers are engraved and not printed, meaning that character contours and color are more complex and less reproductible
* metal is more ductible, so marks and shape alteration are more common
* the amount of real pictures available on the internet is scarcer
* character orientation can vary quite significantly
* experts expectation on the level on required level of identification. Check out the American Numismatic Association Coin Grading Scale to give you an idea.

On the good side, the coins are well more structured than random images.
